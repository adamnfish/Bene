<?php
/*
A database instance
interface?

This interface is used to define the required behaviour should someone want to plug in an api layer
I'm going to try and use PDO by default, and leave it 'as an exercise for the user' to create apis

* WAIT
I *really* should do a YQL one, which opens up basically any api...

For now, I'll get cracking using PDO
