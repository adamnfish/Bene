Bene
====

A PHP MVC framework.

Notes
=====

I'm unlikely to pursue this because I prefer to write Python these
days but I've published Bene on Github as a record of the efforts I
made to create this framework. Of particular note is JDOS (JSON Domain
Object Syntax), which was developed to create a uniform way of
defining a project's models. By adding a generator JDOS could be
integrated into any framework (Rails, Django, etc).

If you find it helpful, please let me know!
