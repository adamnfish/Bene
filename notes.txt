NOTES

Create an 'internals' folder in the project
	This will contain 'compiled' cache type things for the project
	compiled in the sense that it is saved as a .php file containgin the raw data (var_export style)
		- _mappings.php
		- project.jdos


create abstract classes for the core classes in a project, so the developer can extend classes ona  priject basis
	- for example, this lets them set a project-wide 404 page by modifying the controller superclass


* Project generation (CLI script) needs to know:
	- project name
	- file root of project
	- location of the project's webroot (webroot must not be the same as / contain file root)
	
	* optional 'detailed mode' builds the Project class in more detail
	- default directory seperator (?)

* Things to be generated by creating a new project
	- folder structure
	- index.php
		- includes ../Project.php
	- set up an _admin section so developer can create mappings etc in a GUI
